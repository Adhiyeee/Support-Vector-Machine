# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This repository contains my implementation of the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm as part of my Machine Learning learning journey.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Implemented using **scikit-learn**.
- Dataset: [Iris dataset].
- Covers:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Train-test split
  - Model training
  - Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - Visualization of results (optional)

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `svm.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full implementation.
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies to run the notebook.
